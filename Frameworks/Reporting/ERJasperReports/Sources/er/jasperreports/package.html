<h1>ERJasperReports</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
ERJasperReports is a framework wrapper around the JasperReports library and its dependent libraries.
You can learn
</p>

<h2>Installation and Setup</h2>
<p>
Include the ERJasperReports framework in your classpath.
</p>


<h2>Quick Start Guide</h2>
<h3>Designing Reports</h3>

<p>
Place your jasper report xml templates (those having the .jrxml extensions) into your application, or framework
Resources folder. Edit the jasper xml design template in place by hand, or by using the convenient 
<a href = "http://sourceforge.net/projects/ireport/files/">iReport&nbsp;application</a>, which can be downloaded from SourceForge. Compile your jrxml design template while you work which will result in a binary template with the
file extensions .jasper in the same directory as the jrxml design template. Image resources may also be
placed in the same Resources directory and referenced by relative path in the report template. At runtime
they will be found by the jasper report engine.
</p>
<p>You will need the iReport application version that
corresponds to the version of JasperReports that is included in this framework to ensure template
compatability. Check the current JasperReports version by looking at the name of the JasperReports jar
in the built framework or in the Libraries directory of the source project. It is also possible
to use a newer version of iReport and to set the JasperReports version compatability in the iReport application
preferences.
</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Use keyPaths that are relative to the detail object as Field names, however since JasperReports will not
	allow us to use the period character in Field names, we use an underscore character instead. If you already
	use underscore in your object attributes, you can define your own JasperReports keyPath separator
	using the property <code>er.jasperreports.keyPathSeparator</code>. For example if Movie (from the ERMoviesLogic
	Movies EOModel) is the detail object of a report, then to make a field that represents the Studio's name,
	we would simply define a Field in the jasper design template as <code>&quot;studio_name&quot;</code> which during report generation
	is the equivalent of executing <code>movie.valueForKeyPath(&quot;studio.name&quot;)</code>
	
	</p>


<p>You can implement the report generation and download logic in your application to test your report while you
are designing it. You can leave your WebObjects app running while you simply switch between the browser to test
the report and iReport application to make changes and compile your changes. Remember that the JasperReports
engine works directly with the compiled .jasper file, not your .jrxml design template, so make sure you compile
using the convenient toolbar button (the one with the hammer icon) after making changes to validate your changes
and to regenerate the .jasper compiled template.</p>

<h3>Report Generation Logic</h3>
<p>ERJasperReports needs three things to generate a report:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The compiled .jasper binary template file in your Resources folder</li>
	<li>A JRDataSource concrete implementation that defines the report <em>detail</em> objects.</li>
	<li>Optionally a HashMap&lt;String,Object&gt; object containing miscellaneous report parameters that you want to use in your report logic.</li>
</ul>

<p>Report generation time is proportional to the number of detail objects in the data source. So in general we
must always plan for reports to be generated in a background task.
ERJasperReports provides a convenient java.util.concurrent.Callable class that does the report generation
and returns a pdf java.io.File result</p>
<p>However you can implement your own background tasks with similar logic as ERJRFetchSpecificationReportTask
if you wish</p>
<p>Here is an example of business logic that creates a report task ready for execution in a background thread:</p>
<code class = "block">
	/**
	 * @return a {@link java.util.concurrent.Callable} task that creates and returns a StudioRevenueReport PDF file
	 */
	public static Callable&lt;File&gt; createStudioRevenueReportTask() {
		// SortOrderings
		// Sort by studio name alphabetical sort
		ERXSortOrderings sortOrderings = Movie.STUDIO.dot(_Studio.NAME).ascs();
		
		// Then sort by Movie Title
		sortOrderings = sortOrderings.then(Movie.TITLE.asc());
		
		// EOQualifier, null for this demo
		EOQualifier qualifier = null;
		
		ERXFetchSpecification&lt;Movie&gt; fs = 
			new ERXFetchSpecification&lt;Movie&gt;(Movie.ENTITY_NAME, qualifier, sortOrderings);
		
		String reportDescription = "A report that subtotals revenue by Studio"
			+ " and lists the Movie revenue detail for each Studio";
		
		HashMap&lt;String, Object&gt; parameters = new HashMap&lt;String, Object&gt;();
		parameters.put("reportDescription", reportDescription);
		parameters.put("userName", "WOWODC Demo");
		
		ERJRFetchSpecificationReportTask reportTask = 
			new ERJRFetchSpecificationReportTask(fs, "StudioRevenueReport.jasper", parameters);
		
		return reportTask;
	}
</code>

<h3>Properties</h3>
<p>The properties below allow you to change the behaviour of ERJasperReports:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>er.jasperreports.keyPathSeparator</dt>
	<dd>Defaults to underscore character. Since the standard WebObjects keypath separator character ( . ) is invalid for jasper report field name definitions
we must use a different character when specifying datasource fields as keypaths in the report template.</dd>

	<dt>er.jasperreports.currentRow.fieldName</dt>
	<dd>Defaults to &quot;_currentRow&quot;. Sometimes we want might want a reference to the current row, perhaps to pass to a custom function in a scriptlet.
This functionality allows us to specify a jasper template field name that returns the current row object itself
rather than an attribute of the current row.</dd>

<h2>Getting More Information</h2>
<p>Get your hands on the 90 minutes &quot;Integrating JasperReports with WebObjects&guot; presentation from
WOWODC 2010 in Montreal. The presentation will be available beginning October 2010 from 
<a href = "http://www.wocommunity.org">http://www.wocommunity.org</a>
</p>

<p>An example application, ERJasperReportsExample, will be committed to Wonder during September 2010 which
will give you everything you need to understand how to make your own reports</p>
