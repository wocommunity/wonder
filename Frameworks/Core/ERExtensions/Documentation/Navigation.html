	Using the ERXNavigationMenu:
	
	(This sample and its excelent comments come from Ramsey Gurley's
	HelloD2W sample application from WOWODC 2010)
	
	In order to enable a navigation menu, you must/should:
	
	1. Add to your properties file:
	er.extensions.ERXNavigationManager.localizeDisplayKeys=true
	
	2. When your app finishes initializing, call:
	ERXNavigationManager.manager().configureNavigation();
	
	3. Create a NavigationMenu.plist file (like this one)
	
	4. Set the navigation context (see the navigationContext() method in MenuHeader)
	
	5. Set the navigationState on the navigation context... more on that in a bit.
		
	*/

		/*
		This defines the root level of the menu. If you add any new level one

	{
		/*
		The name of your navigation item is used to identify your navigation
		state as well.  So in your context, if you want the named item to
		appear selected, you need to have a navigation state that matches.
		
		For example, let us say in your menu hierarchy you want a second 
		level item to appear selected. Your navigation state should look 
		something like "Parent.Child" where "Parent" is the name of the 
		level one menu item, and "Child" is the name of the level two menu 
		item.

<li>what do I do with it?<br>
  You create a page wrapper like: </li>
<code><pre>
.html: 
	&lt;webobject name="Navigation"/&gt;&lt;webobject name="Content"/&gt;
.wod: 
	Navigation: ERXNavigationMenu {context = myContext;}
	Content: WOComponentContent {}
.java:
	...
    public NSKeyValueCoding navigationContext() {
        NSKeyValueCoding context = (NSKeyValueCoding)session().objectForKey("navigationContext");
        
        if (context().page() instanceof D2WPage) {
            context = ((D2WPage)context().page()).d2wContext();
        }
		return context;
	}	
	</pre></code><br>
	The important thing is that if you provide a context, then the context needs to be able to find out the current state. 
	So, in the case of a D2WContext you would check if the pageConfigiration is a given value and return the "path" to this "page" in the rules.
	If you don't give a context, then you need to set the state explicitely: given the example above, you need to write:
<code><pre>
public Session ...
	public WOComponent createSomething() {
		ERXNavigationManager.manager().navigationStateForSession(session()).setState(new NSArray(new Object[] {
			"First Level Item",
			"Second Level Item"
		}));
		... do real action...
	}
...	</pre></code><br>
