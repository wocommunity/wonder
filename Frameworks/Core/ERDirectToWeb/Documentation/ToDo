    
- Printer Friendly is broken
- So is mass move

- Introduce ERNeutralLook; neutral look enhanced with ER's tricks:
    - property name display (mandatory marker, error market)
    - better error display
    - debug toggle


- Implement the calendar page, potentially with it's own date datasource
- Add back in branch delegates for message pages.
- Move XML and CSV stuff to it's own framework
- Add formal interface for Picks, could integrate with Select interface.
- Add ability so that branch delegates can return set of branches, not requiring specifying in rules if not needed.
- Clean up validation handling.

- Add qualifier and assignmnt uniquing for depolyment (smaller memory footprint), also should add an ApplicationWillExit notification so that the rule cache can be saved and reloaded at a later point.
- Need to consolidate all of the Boolean custom components into one edit and one display, (ERD2WCustomDisplayBoolean, ERD2WCustomEditBoolean, ERD2WDisplayYesNo, ERD2WEditYesNo, ERD2WEditAllowRestrict)
- Better integration of units throughout. No need to have custom components for unit display/edit.
- Need to make a pass through the framework and replace all localContext with d2wContext.  Be careful though as some of the setLocalContext methods have been overridden to do special things.
- Need a better way to handle using ERXNumberFormatter, sharing one is not thread safe and setting the pattern could
    leave it in a bad state. See ERD2WEditNumber
- Might want to consider stricter naming for components as to their associated tasks, i.e. all query components would be 
    ERD2WQuery* or all edit components would be ERD2WEdit*
- Something to consider, we could enhance ERDCustomEditComponent even further so that if the subclass of that component is non-synching or stateless than you wouldn't need to use the ERD2WCustomComponentWithArgs, instead the component would realize that it has the d2wContext bound directly to it in which case it could resolve the binding request in the same way that ERD2WCustomComponentWithArgs does not.
- Completely revist the permission model, i.e. permissionToEdit stuff.
- get all of the image names in line with the rest of the name schemes.
- Move a lot of the functionality of ERDCustomEditComponent up to something like ERXComponent so that some of the strange 
    sub-classing in this framework can be straightened out.
    - General pass over all api files of components that can be used in and out of D2W.

Property-Level components
ERDEditDatePopupCommon: Localization support for dates and date format.
ERD2WCustomComponentWithArgs: Remove extraBindings as it isn't used now that we can resolve value for binding requests
    against the rules.
ERD2WDisplayToManyTable: Should use ERXTable with all the bells and whistles.
ERD2WDisplayURL: Target should be configurable.
ERD2WEditPercentage: Need to be able to configure the percentage choices.
ERD2WEditToManyRelationship: Localize hardcoded messages.
ERD2WPickFromEntities: A little hackish the way the list is put together, noSlectionString should come from the context.
ERD2WPickFromList: noSlectionString should come from the context, no hardcoding.
ERD2WPopUp: Should be renamed and maybe removed, really is a popup selection of numbers. The number list should also 
    be dynamic.
ERD2WQueryNonNull: Localized selection list.
ERD2WStatelessCustomComponentWithArgs: Remove extrabindings stuff.
ERD2WTwoLevelEditToOneRelationship: Might be worth renaming to ERD2WJSTwoLevelEditToOneRelationship.
ERD2WDisplayStringWithLineBreaks: Doesn't work as expected. Should either be fixed or the functionality should be rolled into
    ERD2WDisplayString with a configurable option to display line breaks.
    
ERDEditStringWithChoices: Bunch of stuff to cleanup in this component. Has a lot of reporting stuff in here that doesn't belong.
ERDQueryDateRangeJavascript: Date format and window name should be configurable/localizable.
ERDDHTMLComponent: Hard coded form name.
ERDDisplayImageIfExists: Might be worth rolling the functionality of this component up into ERD2WDisplayImage and then dropping
    this component.
ERDDisplayYearsMonths: Localization support for years and months.
ERDEditButton: Alt tag should be localized.
ERDEditDateJavascript: Localized date formats.
ERDEditDatePopup: Localization for popup lables.
ERDEditDatePopupOrNull: Should be integrated into ERDEditDatePopup and then this component should be dropped.
ERDEditOwnedRelationship: Train wreck of a component. Lots of cleanup to be done in this one.
ERDEditYearsMonths: Localized.
ERDListOrganizer: Should be renamed seeing as it is a Many-Many relationship picker in JS, bunch of stuff to cleanup.
    Need to get rid of all the hard coded reports stuff as well as the /nsi/ image references.
ERDListPicker: iFrameName should be a wee bit better.
ERDEditList: This is actually a template of sorts, although the superclass doesn't reflect that.
ERDEditList: Hardcoded PageWrapper, not localized. 

Qualifiers
ERDNullQualifier: Needs to subclass EOQualifier

Template Pieces
ERD2WPropertyName: Need to integrate in high-lighting of property names where validation exceptions happend. 
ERDEmptyListMessage: Need to remove hardcoded message now that a message will always showup.

Templates

Remove Files: 
ERDDelayedRuleAssignment - This is a very silly component that expects an array of serialized rules, very dumb.
ERDCustomComponent - Same as ERDCustomEditComponent, just with a different name.
ERD2WDisplayHTML - Should add the ability to resolve escapeHTML from the rules and then add this 
    to to ERD2WDisplayString.
ERD2WDisplayImageWithUrl or ERD2WDisplayImage - They both do the same thing, ERD2WDisplayImage has more options but 
    ERD2WDisplayImageWithUrl has a better name.
ERDDisplayNumberWithUnit: No WOComponent also all the functionality is in ERD2WDisplayNumberWithUnit
ERD2WDisplayAddress: Very NS specific. Not worth generalizing.
ERDEmptyPageWrapper: Already have an empty page wrapper D2WEmptyWrapper, no need for two.
ERDFilterDisplayGroupButton: Localize links.
ERDTabImage: Doesn't do anything.
