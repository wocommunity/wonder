<h1>ERAttachment</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
It is a common requirement to be able to have arbitrary attachments of images, files, or documents throughout your
WebObjects application.  ERAttachment framework was inspired by the Rails attachment_fu gem to provide a simple
mechanism of adding attachments to your application that abstract the actual storage requirements for those 
attachments.  The framework provide a single unified set of components and models that can allow the storage of
attachments on your local filesystem, served through your webserver; on your local filesystem served through 
a custom request handler; in your database, served through a custom request handler; and on Amazon's S3 service,
served directly from S3.  The intent of the framework is to make it very simple to control how the attachments
are stored and served by simple adjusting some configuration properties.
</p>

<h2>Installation and Setup</h2>
<p>
If you use Project Wonder migrations and migrateOnStartup, then the ERAttachment tables will be automatically created
for you on the first launch.  If you do no, then you can either manually execute the .migration SQL scripts that are
in the Resources folder, or you can open the EOModel and generate SQL for your particular database.
</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>
Each processor has different settings that are required to be able to perform an attachment import.  A concept that
is carried through all of them, however, is that of a "configuration".  It's very likely that a simple application
may have multiple attachment columns -- maybe a Person has an avatar, and a Bug has a screenshot.  In this case,
it is also often desirable to have different configuration sets for each type of attachment.  All of the 
configuration settings can be overriden on a per configuration basis.  For instance, if you set the value
"er.attachment.s3.bucket" as the default bucket to put attachments into, you could also define a configuration 
"Person.avatar" (the actual String is unimportant, but a good idea is to make it EntityName.relationshipName to
keep things clear) and then also define a property "er.attachment.s3.Person.avatar.bucket" which would override
the bucket definition of any "Person.avatar" configuration.  All of the ERAttachment components allow you to
pass in a configurationName binding which corresponds to this concept.
</p>

<h2>Global Properties</h2>
<p>
There are some properties that apply to all attachment types.
</p>

<dl>
	<dt>er.attachment.maxSize / er.attachment.[configurationName].maxSize</dt>
	<dd>(optional) The maximum size in bytes for an attachment upload.  Currently this is only enforced <em>after</em> the upload has finished.  
	If you are using AjaxFileUpload, you can also set the max size for Ajax uploads which is checked during the upload, although 
	currently there are no per-configation overrides for this.  This behavior will soon be cleaned up and unified so that the max
	size is enforced prior to and during the upload with configuration overrides.  The default is unlimited.</dd>

	<dt>er.attachment.tempFolder / er.attachment.[configurationName].tempFolder</dt>
	<dd>(optional) For WOFileUpload (not Ajax), this specifies the temp folder to write incoming uploads into.  For Ajax, use the 
	settings defined by AjaxFileUpload component and AjaxFileUploadRequestHandler. The default is the Java definition of the 
	temp folder (/tmp for Mac OS X and UNIXes).</dd>
	
	<dt>er.attachment.storageType / er.attachment.[configurationName].storageType</dt>
	<dd>(optional) When using the ERAttachmentUpload component, this sets the default storage type to use for the attachment.  Examples
	are "s3", "db", or "file".  The default is "db".</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Path Templates</h2>
<p>
Several attachment types define filesystem and webserver paths for storing and accessing attachments.  A very simple set of 
template variables are defined for use in the definition of these paths.
</p>

<dl>
	<dt>${ext}</dt>
	<dd>Attempts to lookup the mime type of the original file (based on its original extension) and returns the primary file
	extension for that mime type including a "." prefix.  For instance, if a user uploads an image/jpg attachment with the
	original extension .JPEG, the variable replacement would be ".jpg".  If there is no mime type found, or the mime type
	does not have a primary extension, the original extension of the file is used.  If there is no original extension, 
	this variable will replace with a blank (i.e. no dot).</dd>

	<dt>${hash}</dt>
	<dd>Produces a series of three folders based on the SHA-1 hash of the original file name ("a/c/9").  This is 
	particularly useful if you are going to have a lot of attachments, because this keeps down the number of files in
	any one directory.</dd>
	
	<dt>${pk}</dt>
	<dd>Replaced by the primary key of the ERAttachment object.</dd>
	
	<dt>${fileName}</dt>
	<dd>Replaced by the original filename as uploaded by the user (including the file extension).</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Database Attachments</h2>
<p>
The easiest attachment type to use, because it has the least amount of setup required is a database attachment.  Database
attachments are stored in the database in the ERAttachmentData table.  Currently this is not using a method like 
the C9ResourceStreamer, which could stream in and out of the a database column, rather it is using normal EOF
NSData blob columns.  Because of the memory characteristics of blob columns in EOF, this attachment type is only suitable
for relatively small data sizes. All database attachments are served through the ERAttachmentRequestHandler.  Because
it is proxied, database attachments provide the capability of security checking access to the attachments from within
your WebObjecst applications (see the section on security below for more info).
</p>

<dl>
	<dt>er.attachment.db.webPath / er.attachment.db.[configurationName].webPath</dt>
	<dd>(optional) The path that will be appended to the URL after the "/attachments" request handler key.  Defaults to "/${pk}${ext}".
	webPaths must be unique across all attachments (including ${pk} ensures this).</dd>
	
	<dt>er.attachment.db.smallData / er.attachment.db.[configurationName].smallData</dt>
	<dd>(optional) Because of the memory characteristics of EOF and large BLOBs, a common design for storing data in an EO
	is to have a to-one relationship that contains the data.  This requires an extra query to retrieve the EO that contains
	the data, but provides better memory performance.  However, if you are storing very small amounts of data -- for instance,
	an avatar icon for a user which may only be 2k, you may decide it's not worth it to require the extra query to get the
	attachment data.  In this case, you can set smallData = true, and the data will be stored in the actual attachment EO
	rather than in a second separated EO.  The default is false.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>File Attachments</h2>
<p>
File attachments give a much greater level of flexibility compared to database attachments.  In particular, file
attachments can be optionally not proxied.  A proxied attachment is one that is served through the ERAttachmentRequestHandler,
and is streamed to the user by your WebObjects application.  A non-proxied attachment is served directly as a static file
through Apache (or whatever webserver you are using).  To be able to use file attachments, your WebObjects application must
have write permission to whatever folders and subfolders you specify as filesystemPath.  Additionally, if you are using
non-proxied attachments, those folders must be externally visible from your webserver (that is, the filesystemPath must be
a subfolder of a document root).  Proxied attachments also provide the capability of security checking access to the
attachments from within your WebObjecst applications (see the section on security below for more info).
</p>

<dl>
	<dt>er.attachment.file.proxy / er.attachment.file.[configurationName].proxy</dt>
	<dd>(optional) If proxy is true, then the attachment's contents will be served through the request handler proxy.  The default
	is true.</dd>
	
	<dt>er.attachment.file.overwrite / er.attachment.file.[configurationName].overwrite</dt>
	<dd>(optional) If you specify a filesystemPath based on ${fileName}, it is possible that you may have duplicates.  If overwrite
	is true, then duplicates will be overwritten.  If false, then a unique name based on the template will be created using
	a "filename-1.gif", "filename-2.gif" scheme. The default is false.</dd>
	
	<dt>er.attachment.file.filesystemPath / er.attachment.file.[configurationName].filesystemPath</dt>
	<dd>(required) The filesystem path specifies the full path of the destination of the uploaded attachment, including its filename.
	This property is evaluated as a path template (see above).  An example might be 
	"/Library/WebServer/Documents/photos/${hash}/${pk}${ext}".</dd>
	
	<dt>er.attachment.file.webPath / er.attachment.file.[configurationName].webPath</dt>
	<dd>(required if proxy is false) The web path specifies the patch relative to the webserver document root (or request handler if
	proxy is true) used to locate the given attachment.  webPaths must be unique across all attachments.  If proxy is false, the
	default webPath is "/${pk}{$ext}".  If the above example of a filesystemPath, if proxy is false, then the appropriate webPath
	would be "/photos/${hash}/${pk}${ext}".</dd>
</dl>

<h2>S3 Attachments</h2>
<p>
Amazon's S3 service is an incredibly cost-effective way to host large amounts of data, which is ideal if you are offering an
attachment system for a public website.  For information about signing up for an account, go to 
<a href = "http://aws.amazon.com/s3">Amazon's S3 Page</a>.
</p>

<dl>
	<dt>er.attachment.s3.accessKeyID / er.attachment.s3.[configurationName].accessKeyID</dt>
	<dd>(required) Your Amazon S3 access key ID.  This is loaded using ERXProperties.decryptedStringForKey if you would like to encrypt it.</dd>
	
	<dt>er.attachment.s3.secretAccessKey / er.attachment.s3.[configurationName].secretAccessKey</dt>
	<dd>(required) Your Amazon S3 secret access key.  This is loaded using ERXProperties.decryptedStringForKey if you would like to encrypt it.</dd>
	
	<dt>er.attachment.s3.bucket / er.attachment.s3.[configurationName].bucket</dt>
	<dd>(required) The name of the bucket to store and retrieve attachments into.  The bucket must already exist in your S3 account.</dd> 

	<dt>er.attachment.s3.key / er.attachment.s3.[configurationName].key</dt>
	<dd>(optional) The name of the file to store in the S3 bucket.  This is evaluated as a path template.  The default value is "${pk}${ext}".</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Mime Types</h2>
<p>
The ERAttachment framework provides support for tracking the definition of various mime types.  You can, however, override and extend the default
definitions.  The mime type of an attachment determines which viewer will be used to display the attachment.
</p>

<dl>
	<dt>er.attachment.mimeTypes</dt>
	<dd>(optional) A comma-separated list of mime types that are defined in the system.  The default is
	"image/bmp,image/eps,image/gif,image/jp2,image/jpeg,image/pdf,image/pict,image/png,image/psd,image/raw,image/tiff,image/x-pict".  If you 
	set this value in your application, it will override the list defined in the framework.</dd>
	
	<dt>er.attachment.additionalMimeTypes</dt>
	<dd>(optional) Just like mimeTypes except it is intended to extend the core list in er.attachment.mimeTypes rather than replace them.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
For each mime type defined in the mimeTypes and additionalMimeTypes properties, there are several additional properties you must specify.
</p>

<dl>
	<dt>er.attachment.mimeType.[mimeType].name</dt>
	<dd>(optional) The display name of the mime type ("Portable Network Graphics")</dd>
	
	<dt>er.attachment.mimeType.[mimeType].uti</dt>
	<dd>(optional) The universal type identifier that corresponds to this mime type</dd>
	
	<dt>er.attachment.mimeType.[mimeType].extensions</dt>
	<dd>(required) A comma-separated list of file extensions that correspond to this mime type.  The first entry in the list will be
	treated as the "primary extension" and is used by, for instance, the ${ext} path template variable.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Attachment Variations</h2>
<p>
Currently there is no support for automatically thumbnailing of attachments or other attachment variations, however the model was
written with the explicit intent of adding this support.
</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>
If you are serving S3 or non-proxied file attachments, security is controlled by S3 and your web server respectively.  However,
if you are serving proxied attachments like database attachments or proxied file attachments, you can provide a delegate to 
implement security checks on your attachment.  Currently the delegate is very simple and does not provide much context for the 
request, but the delegate features will be extended over time.
</p>

<p>
To provide a delegate, you must implement the ERAttachmentRequestHandler.Delegate interface, and in your application constructor, 
you can call:
</p>

<code>
((ERAttachmentRequestHandler) WOApplication.application().requestHandlerForKey(ERAttachmentRequestHandler.REQUEST_HANDLER_KEY)).setDelegate(yourCustomDelegate);
</code>

<p>
The delegate interface has one method, which is passed the ERAttachment that the user requested along with the WORequest and 
WOContext, which you can use to lookup session information as well as authentication and authorization information.  You can use
the configurationName() property of ERAttachment to determine which security context you are evaluating the attachment in.
</p>

<h2>Modeling Attachments</h2>
<p>
To use attachments, you will need to add support for one or more attachment relationships in your EOModel.  Let's take the
example of a Person with an avatar image.  In our Person EO, we would add:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>An non-class, allows null property "avatarID" (of type "id" if you use ERPrototypes)</li>
	<li>An optional relationship "avatar" that joins Person.avatarID to ERAttachment.id</li>
</ol>
<p>
And that's it ... You're done modeling.
</p>

<h2>Uploading Attachments</h2>
<p>
Uploading attachments into the system is very easy.  You can either use the ERAttachmentUpload component, which provides a 
very thin layer of features on top of either a WOFileUpload or an AjaxFileUpload component; or you can use your own 
WOFileUpload and call the attachment import API directly.
</p>

<p>
Let's look at the case of uploading an avatar attachment for our Person again.  We want to upload our avatars to S3
using a non-Ajax file upload in this example.
</p>

<h3>Properties</h3>
<code>
er.attachment.Person.avatar.storageType=s3
er.attachment.s3.Person.avatar.accessKeyID=xxxxxxxxxx
er.attachment.s3.Person.avatar.secretAccessKey=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
er.attachment.s3.Person.avatar.bucket=Avatars
</code>

<h3>WOD</h3>
<code>
AvatarForm : WOForm {
	enctype = "multipart/form-data";
	multipleSubmit = true;
}

AvatarUpload : ERAttachmentUpload {
	configurationName = "Person.avatar";
	editingContext = person.editingContext;
	attachment = person.avatar;
}

UploadAction : WOSubmitButton {
	action = uploadAvatar;
	value = "Upload Avatar!";
}
</code>

<p>
And that's it.  When the file is uploaded, it will be processed and posted to S3.  You can override "storageType" on the 
ERAttachmentUpload, as well as "mimeType" if you are only uploading specific mimeTypes.
</p>

<p>
However, you may want to use your own WOFileUpload in a form, or maybe you have an existing upload process.  In this case, 
you will want to call the API directly.  Fortunately this is very simple to do:
</p>

<code>
ERAttachment attachment = ERAttachmentProcessor.processorForType(storageType).process(editingContext, uploadedFile, originalFileName, mimeType, configurationName);
</code>

<p>
In this example, storageType would be "s3", editingContext would be the editing context to create the attachment within, uploadedFile
would be a java.io.File reference to the temporary file (which will be deleted after processing), originalFileName is the name the
user gave the attachment on upload, mimeType can be null or set explicitly (if null, it will be guessed from the originalFileName 
extension), and configurationName is the name of the configuration properties to use.
</p>

<p>
Note: Once you select the storageType for an avatar, there are currently no tools for changing your mind later.  You would need
to manually edit the ERAttachment objects if you want to, for instance, move your S3 attachments back onto a local machine and 
convert them to file attachments.  The API provides most of the underlying tools to do the data management, but the grunt 
work of actually switching everything around is left as an exercise for the reader :)
</p>

<h2>Viewing Attachments</h2>
<p>
There are two ways to view an attachment -- linking or embedding.  To embed an attachment in the page (assuming it is an
embeddeable type), you can use the ERAttachmentViewer component.  If the attachment type is not one that has a renderer,
ERAttachmentViewer will display a link to the attachment instead.  If you only want to provide a link, ERAttachmentLink
works basically link a WOHyperlink except that you provide a configurationName and attachment reference.
</p>

<code>
Avatar : ERAttachmentViewer {
	configurationName = "Person.avatar";
	attachment = person.avatar;
	width = 50; 
}

AvatarLink : ERAttachmentLink {
	configurationName = "Person.avatar";
	attachment = person.avatar;
}
</code>

<p>
Note: Currently ERAttachmentViewer is a monolithic design.  This will be modified in the future to instead use
WOSwitchComponents and allow custom definitions of viewer components based on the attachment's mime type.
</p>

<h2>Custom Storage</h2>
<p>
ERAttachment is written with a modular design.  If you want to provide your own storage locations, you can: 
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Add a single-table inheritance ERAttachment subclass with a custom storageType.</li>
	<li>Add a custom ERAttachmentProcessor subclass that can import into, and provide URLs onto, the storage location.</li> 
</ol>
