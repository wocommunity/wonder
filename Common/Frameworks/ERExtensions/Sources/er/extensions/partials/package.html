<h1>Partial Entities</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Partial Entities provide a mechanism for defining a single entity whose definition spans across multiple EOModels 
along with tools to interact with these partial definitions in a type-safe way.
</p>
<p>
Partial entities are specifically designed to allow reuse and extension of existing models.  A very common case 
where this becomes useful is that of a Person entity.  Person is an entity that is used in many different 
scenarios, each of which requires additional attributes and relationships.  For instance, you may have a 
task management application and you want to embed your calendaring framework into it.  The common 
Person base entity may have "username" and "password" attributes, the tasking application may add an 
"activeTasks" relationship, and the calendaring framework may add a "scheduledEvents" relationship as well
as "dayStartTime" and "dayEndTime" attributes.  Note that partials are not designed to address the issue of
"roles," where different people in the system may have different roles at different times.  Partial entities
are designed to address the issue of combining high level modules together to form more complex static 
entity declarations.
</p>
<p>
Traditionally, this presents some complicated problems.  How do you add these relationships onto your
Person entity?  Additionally, these different views of a Person technically represent the same underlying
object, and ideally we want to be able to fetch these views without having to always traverse additional
relationships for every view type.  For instance, if CalendarPerson is a "role" of Person and stored
as a separate entity (table) in the database, it would require traversing a relationship every time you
need to reference calendar-specific attributes of a Person, which can be a serious performance issue if 
you need to show CalendarPerson attributes of multiple Person objects at time.  Prefetching can alleviate
some of this overhead, but semantically speaking, Person, CalendarPerson, and TaskPerson ARE the same
entity, just as seen from different parts of your system. EOGenericRecord allows a certain amount of 
flexibility, but in exchange for a loss of type-safety.  Java's type system does not allow mixins like Ruby, 
which means that you cannot just "inject" the get/set methods into the Person class and actually be able to 
get compile-type checking on these methods.
</p>

<h2>Design</h2>
<p>
Enter Partial Entities.  With partial entities, you can declare a base Person entity, a TaskPerson partial
entity that adds the "activeTasks" relationship, and a CalendarPerson partial entity that adds the 
"scheduledEvents" relationship and the "dayStartTime" and "dayEndTime" attributes.  At runtime, the base
and partial entities are merged together such that the entity named "Person" is the union of all of the 
attributes and relationships of all of its partials.  In fact, the "partial entities" are not entities at
all, but rather exist only as special cover classes that are generated by VelocityEOGenerator to allow
compile-time type checking and get/set method access.  The ability of partials to merge into a single entity
means that the underlying representation in the database is such that a single row represents the union
of all of the attributes of Person+CalendarPerson+TaskPerson.  The makes for fairly optimal fetching behavior.
</p>
<p>
The design of the Java side of partial entities is inspired by the concept of an IAdaptable in Eclipse.  Eclipse
has similar problem design constraints in that it provides extension mechanisms for many types of classes
in the system.  Because Java lacks the concept of categories or mixins, there is no formal mechanism to extend
an existing class with a compile-type-checked interface.  IAdaptable in Eclipse provides a very simple interface
to ask a class to adapt itself into another interface, which can consult a factory to perform that lookup. A 
common example of this is that you may ask a Project for its JavaProject interface, which provides additional
capabilities that are specific to a JavaProject.  In Partial Entities, we use the capabilities of 
EOF to provide the underlying flexible datastore for the entity state (that is, EOF doesn't care if we tell it
that Person now has 3 new relationships and 4 new attributes as long as the underlying database definition
agrees when it comes time to fetch or save).  We use the IAdaptable concept to address type-safe Java 
interfaces to this state.  Velocity EOGenerator has been extended to support the generation of special 
"partial entity" templates.  These templates are very similar to normal EO templates except that where
normal EO's extend EOGenericRecord (or ERXPartialGenericRecord in the case of partial base entities), the
partials themselves extend ERXPartial, which is NOT a subclass of EOEnterpriseObject.  It is an important 
concept that the partials are ONLY a type-safe wrapper around a single EO.  Person is the only EO in the
above example.  CalendarPerson and TaskPerson are simply type-safe "views" of Person.
</p>

<h2>Example</h2>
<p>
In code there are two ways to access the partial covers for an EO.  In Java, you will want to use the 
programmatic interface, and in components you will want to use the binding method.  The two styles 
look like:
</p>
<pre>
Person person = ...; // fetch a Person EO from the database
CalendarPerson calendarPerson = person.partialForClass(CalendarPerson.class);
calendarPerson.setDayStartTime(new NSTimestamp());
System.out.println(calendarPerson.dayStartTime());

TaskPerson taskPerson = person.partialForClass(TaskPerson.class);
System.out.println(taskPerson.activeTasks());
</pre>
or
<pre>
DayStartTime : WOString {
	value = person.@CalendarPerson.dayStartTime;
	dateformat = "%m/%d/%y";
}
</pre>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
So how do you take advantage of partials?  There are several pieces.  Entities in your models need to be
annotated as partials, the runtime needs to be notified of them, and Java code needs to be generated to 
take care of the tedium of repetitive implementation. Partial entities require the use of Project Wonder, 
the latest WOLips/Entity Modeler, and the latest Velocity EOGenerator (which is built into WOLips).
</p>
<h3>Model</h3>
<p>
In Entity Modeler, there is a new option under the Advanced tab of an Entity that allows the selection of
a "Partial Entity".  The Partial Entity is the base entity that a particular entity will augment.  For instance
"CalendarPerson"'s Partial Entity is "Person".  Currently, a partial cannot augment another partial.  For instance,
"TaskPerson" cannot be a partial entity for "CalendarPerson," rather they can only be a partial of the base 
"Person" entity.
</p>
<p>
Any attribute of the base entity can be duplicated in the partials if it makes creating
relationships easier -- these will just be skipped when the entities are merged at runtime.  For instance, it
may be easier to setup your partial's relationships if you duplicate the PK's into the partial entities.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, in your model, you should specify the class name of each partial entity.  For instance, CalendarPerson
may be com.mdimension.calendar.model.CalendarPerson, whereas TaskPerson might be 
com.mdimension.tasking.model.TaskPerson.  "External name" on partial entities is currently ignored, but should
be set to be the same as the base entity (for instance, CalendarPerson's external name should be "Person", to
imply that the CalendarPerson entity will be in the Person table).
</p>
<h3>Code Generation</h3>
<p>
Currently, only the Velocity EOGenerator in WOLips is able to generate code for partial entities.  In the 
Defines section of your model's EOGenerator configuration, you should specify that your EOGenericRecord class
should be er.extensions.partials.ERXPartialGenericRecord (rather than er.extensions.ERXGenericRecord like you
normally would).  The Velocity templates will automatically make the superclass of partial classes 
er.extensions.partials.ERXPartial, but the "ERXPartial partialForClass(Class)" method is only on 
ERXPartialGenericRecord.
</p>
<h3>SQL Generation</h3>
<p>
SQL Generation with partials is a complicated subject, but ideally you should use the ERMigrations API's to
create your tables.  With migrations, you can have your base framework create the generic Person table, 
the Calendar framework can add the appropriate columns for CalendarPerson, and the Tasking application can
add the appropriate columns for tasking.  If you generate SQL directly out of Entity Modeler, you will likely
get multiple definitions for the same table names, which would need to be manually merged.
</p>
<h3>Runtime</h3>
<p>
To enable the use of partials at runtime, you should set the property:
</p>
<pre>
er.extensions.partials.enabled=true
</pre>
<p>
This will trigger the runtime system to do entity merging for you.  To use the partials at runtime, refer back
to the Examples section above.
