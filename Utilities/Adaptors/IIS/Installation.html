<H2>Microsoft IIS 5-6 Web Server ISAPI Adaptor for WebObjects</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
Please familiarize yourself with your WebServer's documentation <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com">here.</A>
</P>
<P>
To install this adaptor, copy the file <CODE>WebObjects.dll</CODE> to your web server's scripts directory.  The adaptor will be loaded into the server the first time a request of the form <CODE>http://.../scripts/WebObjects.dll</CODE> is made.  It will remain active in the server until you stop the server.
On IIS6 take care to register WebObjects.dll as registered WebServer extension.
</P>
<P>
ISAPI doesn't provide any specific way to pass information into the adaptor, so the Registry is used. Modifying the Registry should only be done by an experienced Windows NT/2000 Adminstrator. To do so, from the Start Menu, choose Run ... and type in "regedit" and return.
</P>
<P>
Look for the panel titled HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.
</P>
<P>
All WebObjects adaptor entries are found in: SOFTWARE\Apple\WebObjects\Configuration
</P>
<P>
To change the configuration URL, you need to add the following entry:
</P>
<PRE>
  CONF_URL &lt;URL&gt;
</PRE>
<P>
Choose New->String Value from the edit menu. Type in "CONF_URL" for the name. Enter the URL you want to use for the value. This might, for example, be file:///Apple/Local/Library/WebObjects/Configuration/WebObjects.conf, if you want to use the old-style configuration. The default is http://localhost:1085.</P>
<P>The URL entered will depend on how you wish to retrieve adaptor configuration:
<OL><LI>to read configuration from a static URL:
<PRE> 
file:///Local/Library/WebObjects/Configuration/WebObjects.xml
http://www.company.com/private/woappconfig.xml
</PRE> </LI>
<LI>to find applications running on known hosts:
<PRE> 
http://woserv1:1085,http://woserv2:1085,http://woserv2:1085
</PRE> </LI>
<LI>to discover hosts using multicast:
<PRE> 
webobjects://239.128.14.2:1085 
</PRE> </LI></OL>
To set the re-read interval for either the host list or multicast mechanisms, set a separate registry entry named "CONF_INTERVAL" to the desired re-read interval in seconds.
</P>

</P>
<P>
Here are some other registry entries recognized by the ISAPI adaptor. The values are as described in the .xml configuration example or the DTD for the adaptor:
</P>
<PRE>
	"WOUSERNAME",
	"WOPASSWORD",
	"CONF_INTERVAL",
	"CONF_URL",
	"SEND_TIMEOUT",
	"RECV_TIMEOUT",
	"CONNECT_TIMEOUT",
	"TIMEOUT",
	"POOL_SIZE",
	"RETRIES",
	"DORMANT_INTERVAL",
	"ERROR_REDIRECT",
	"LOG_PATH",
	"SCHEDULER",
	"DOCUMENT_ROOT".
</PRE>
Setting WOUSERNAME to "public" allows anyone to see the WOAdaptorInfo page.

<H2>Microsoft IIS 7.x Web Server ISAPI Adaptor for WebObjects</H2>

Additionally to the tasks mentioned above, you have to take care that ISAPI-extensions are installed.
WebObjects.dll has to be registered unter CGI-/ISAPI-Restrictions. Unter Handler-Mappings, enable DLL-Exection.

By using MINGW you can build WebObjects-Adaptor as 32bit and as 64bit-DLL.

The 32-Bit-DLL will run fine on 32-Bit IIS and 64-Bit-DLL will run fine on 64-Bit IIS.<br/>
When you intend to use the 32-Bit-DLL with an 64-Bit IIS, take care to configure the application pool to run in 32 bit mode and configure all registry keys named above in the Wow6432Node.
