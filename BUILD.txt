Building Instructions
=========================

You can build Project Wonder with Ant, Maven and Eclipse.

For information on getting started with Project Wonder, go to:

    http://wiki.objectstyle.org/confluence/display/WONDER

Building with Ant:
=========================

Ant should be found in /usr/share/ant/bin/ant

0. Prerequisites:

   ant 1.7: execute 'ant -version' to confirm that ant is properly installed
            and that it is at version 1.7 or later.

1. Open a terminal and cd into the Wonder root directory.

2. A servlet.jar file needs to be available for some parts of Wonder. On Mac OS X, the
   servlet.jar file should be located under the /Developer/Java/J2EE directory. The
   servlet.jar file can be placed in the /Library/WebObjects/Extensions directory,
   or its equivalent on a Windows system.

3. A wobuild.properties file should be placed in, on Mac OS X, the ~/Library directory.
   You can also symlink ~/Library/wobuild.properties to your existing
   ~/Library/Application Support/WOLips/wolips.properties

   On Windows, this should go into a Library folder in the directory pointed to
   by the 'user.home' Java system property. Usually, this may be at
   C:\Documents and Settings\<user name>\Library.

   An example of this file is:

   ==== START wobuild.properties ====

   wo.woroot=/
   wo.wosystemroot=/System
   wo.wolocalroot=/

   ==== END wobuild.properties ====

   These may, or may not, be necessary for some functionality:

   ==== START wobuild.properties, perhaps  ====

   wo.dir.root=/
   wo.dir.user.home.library.frameworks=/User/yourname/Library/Frameworks
   wo.dir.local=/
   wo.dir.library=/System/Library
   wo.dir.user.home.library=/User/yourname/Library
   wo.dir.local.library=/Library
   wo.dir.library.frameworks=/System/Library/Frameworks
   wo.dir.local.library.frameworks=/Library/Frameworks
   wo.dir.system=/System

   ==== END wobuild.properties, perhaps  ====

4. Invoke ant -projecthelp, but normally you would do for WO:

  ant clean frameworks; sudo ant frameworks.install
  ant applications; sudo ant applications.install
  ant examples; sudo ant examples.install

If you have write privileges in /Library/Frameworks, /Library/WebObjects/JavaApplications, and
/Library/WebServer/Documents/WebObjects/Frameworks, you may do without the "sudo".

Building with Maven:
=========================

Steps 1 and 2 are required only once or when you clean your local Maven repository (rm -Rf ~/.m2/repository).

1. Download and Install Maven (http://maven.apache.org)

2. Import the WebObjects frameworks as jars into the local repository:

  mvn wobootstrap:install

See http://wiki.objectstyle.org/confluence/display/WOL/Quick+Start for the settings.xml
needed to make this work.

3. Open a terminal and cd into the Wonder root directory.

4. Build Wonder:

  mvn clean install

NOTE: Make sure you have your settings.xml properly configured.
See the step 2 of Maven Quick Start Tutorial for more information:

    http://wiki.objectstyle.org/confluence/display/WOL/Quick+Start

Deploying Releases with Maven:
==============================

It's naturally highly beneficial to build your own products against a fixed version / release of Wonder
rather than a snapshot. The following script can automate these steps:
- svn revert
- svn up
- substituting the pom's version with the svn version (e.g., 5.0.0-SNAPSHOT becomes 5.0.0.1234),
- mvn clean [package | install | deploy ] with relevant properties / profile
- clean
- svn revert

  See:
  ant -f Build/build/maven.release.xml help

Building with Eclipse:
=========================

1. Install Eclipse http://www.eclipse.org

2. Install WOLips

3. Open the projects you need, choose "WOLips>Install..." in the context menu
